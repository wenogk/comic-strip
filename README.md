# Project Name: Period.s


## Project Description:
The purpose of this comic is to normalize the idea of menstruation to children. Until today many women around the world continue to stop their education after they have their first menstruation. It is very important to empower young girls by giving them access to information and resources so they can develop a healthy relationship between their period, their bodies and their self-esteem. Menstruation sounds scary for many people because it is a spoken topic in many cultures. Menstruation is perceived as a taboo in different societies. By creating this project, we are hoping to normalize this topic in our cultures along the lines of introducing the idea for little kids and allowing young girls to express themselves freely.


## Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?

I was inspired by a story that my (Pam) sister wrote (she is a storyteller for kids) so the content (the drawings existed before the idea of making it a comic). So, after deciding what topic we were to develop collectively as the theme is relevant to social issues. We divided tasks but still worked and communicated as a whole during all stages of the project. Romeno and Saad worked on the web development part. Romeno implemented the displaying story, sequence logic & animation of the site. Saad worked on the interactivity of the website which included the implementation of the svg hover sound effects, cursor change, and in addition the speed optimization. Pam worked on illustrator, the design features, and redrew all of the images on illustrator .

We decided to make it simplistic and friendly to welcome audiences from different ages to explore menstruation. We wanted the user experience and animations to be as smooth as possible so the viewer could focus on the story.  To add to the story we were trying to tell, we thought it would be an important part to add sound effects, just to make the user be able to not only visualize what's happening but also listen to it and feel what the character is experiencing (Pain sound, heart rate, blood dripping, typing, clockâ€¦).


## Reflection/Evaluation:

We are very happy about this project and its accessibility by making it in different languages. We would have liked to make it more responsive for smartphone devices as for now it is only responsive for any desktop / laptop resolution.
