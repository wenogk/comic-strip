- Project Name: Period.s

- Project Description: 
The purpose of this comic is to normalize the idea of menstruation to children. 
Until today many women around the world continue to stop their education after they have their first menstruation. 
It is very important to empower young girls by giving them access to information and resources so they can develop a healthy relationship between their period, their bodies and their self-esteem. 
Menstruation sounds scary for many people because it is an spoken topic in many cultures. 
Menstruation is perceived as a taboo in different societies. 
By creating this project, we are hoping to normalize this topic in our cultures along the lines of introducing the idea for little kids and allowing young girls to express themselves freely.


- Process: How did you go about implementing the concept? 

I was inspired by a story that my sister wrote (she is a storyteller for kids) so the content (the drawings existed before the idea of making it a comic).
So, after deciding what topic we were to develop collectively as the theme is relevant to social issues. We divided tasks but still worked and communicated as a whole during all stages of the project.
Romeno implemented the wireframe and saad worked mostly on the interactivity. Pam worked on illustrator and the design features. We decided to make it simplistic and friendly to welcome audiences from different ages to explore menstruation. 

- Reflection/Evaluation: We are very happy about this project and its accessibility by making it in difference languages. We would have liked to make it more responsive for smartphone devices. 

(note: this is Pam talking, I appreciate a lot our team effort because we use as an advantage our better skills but that do not comparmentalized our roles in making the project. Thank you, guys! I am veryyyyy happy!!!!)
